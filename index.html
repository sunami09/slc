        <p>The SLC is dedicated to fostering an inclusive and supportive learning environment. We believe in the potential of every student and are committed to helping them achieve their academic goals. Our tutors play a crucial role in this mission by providing peer-to-peer tutoring, facilitating study groups, and offering academic support in a variety of subjects.</p>
        <p>As a tutor, you will not only help students understand course material but also equip them with the skills and confidence to become independent learners. We look forward to working with you to make a positive impact on our student community.</p>
